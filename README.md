# Kaggle Titanic Competition
This is a side-project I'm doing to explore data science techniques for 
1. analyzing data
2. imputing data
3. choosing best models/classifiers

Each commit should correspond to a new technique or model I'm trying. The accuracies are from the kaggle site which is ran on a withheld test dataset and are not guaranteed to monotonically increase
